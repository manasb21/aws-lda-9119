# ADR - PPRO

- **Requirements**
    
    *Create a minimalistic application designed to run on AWS, which upon receiving a HTTP GET / request will connect to a database, fetch a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù string from it and return it as a reply to the requester. This application needs to support two distinct infrastructure environments: dev and prod.*
    
    > The deliverable is only the Application and Infrastructure code, which we would use to deploy in our own AWS Accounts during the evaluation. We don‚Äôt expect you to have the application actually running on your own AWS Account (and thus inflicting potential cost). We assume that this solution can be done using services which are covered by the AWS Free Tier ([https://aws.amazon.com/free](https://aws.amazon.com/free)). All resources should be managed in your codebase (i.e. both Application and Infrastructure), and needs to be shared with us via an open git repository hosted on GitHub or GitLab. Your repository should have instructions on how to install the local dependencies for developing
    the application and infrastructure - you can optionally assume your target audience uses MacOS and/or Linux. our repository should have instructions on how to deploy the application to AWS, plus a CI/CD definition file (e.g. for GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.) for deploying the code to the production environment when a Pull Request (or similar) is merged into the main/master branch.

- **Technology Stack**
    - AWS lambda
    - AWS API Gateway
    - AWS DynamoDB
    - Terraform
    - Golang 1.17.6
- **Implementation Idea**
    
    The requirement suggests a 3 tier architecture which involves a front end , a middleware and a database to store the required data ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù.
    
    To achieve this architecture, a number of ways can be implemented as suggested below
    
    - FRONTEND ASG/ ECS/EKS ‚Äî> ASG/ECS/EKS middleware app ‚Äî> RDS database (postgres/ mysql)
    - FRONTEND APIGW (HTTP/REST) ‚Äî> PROXY ‚Äî> lambda function ‚Äî> AWS Dynamodb
    
    The requirements also suggests that we should achieve it as simply as possible without incurring significant charges . For this purpose the best idea, that can be implemented is the later with API GW acting as endpoint  to trigger LAMBDA which will connect to the dynamodb to fetch the details.

- **Planning**
    
    We are going to implement Iac via terraform , and write the lambda function in golang . 
    
    - Why Terraform
        
        Terraform is one of the best tool available to achieve Infrastructure as code. It provides flexibility to create modules and use them to create multiple environments. Terraform maintains a state which is crucial to a mutating infrastructure, where we do not affect any existing infrastructure and just apply the new changes. Lastly terraform has a vast pool of opensource modules both maintained by AWS and opensource community.
        
    - What other tools can be used ?
        
        Other tools which can also achieve the desired state are cloud formation, aws sdk , aws cdk , terraform cdk , pulumi , crossplane etc. Most of the tools provide similar capabilities when comes to Iac. However, ability to efficiently write dry code has been seen in terraform , crossplane and aws cloudformation for now.
        
    - Why Golang ?
        
        Golang is a strongly types language with focus on security, coding standard and it is deployed after compiled as a binary. It makes it fast, efficient and secure.

    **application** 
    
    application hs 2 folders .
    
    **hello-world** : folder contains code for the lambda function which is used to retrieve the data from dynamodb
    
    **bin** : folder is used to store the compiled binary of the lambda code in the runtime
    
    **infrastructure**
    
    Infrastructure folder contains the terraform modules , terraform environment codes and the common CI/CD pipeline to be used by github actions.
    
    CI-CD folder contains ppro-workspaces.yml to perform terraform actions
    
    environments/eu-central-1 contains code for dev and prod environments if they are implemented in the same region. if the region changes with some other regional changed to the code  the same code can be replicated to a different region with different values.
    
    bootstrap folder contains the code for   creating the initial base infrastructure for terraform to be applied. Terraform needs a remote state which in this case will be stored in s3. terraform also needs a dynamodb lock table which locks the state when it is in application.
    
    values folder contains the mutatble entities of this entire repository after the application directory. 
    
    > NOTE: The only places the developers or devOps need to change to achieve desired state are the application directory or the values directory for the current requirement. If the requirements change from GET to any other HTTP method , it needs to be present in modules directory
    > 
    
    **scripts**
    
    This folder contains the scripts that can be used from local to achieve the same goals as the CI/CD pipeline
    
- **How to apply the changes**
    
    There are 2 methods of applying the changes for this infrastructure.
    
    1. github Actions
    2. Local build

To perform deployment with github actions, please see page :

[Github Actions](https://www.notion.so/Github-Actions-c85771b17ad04bae8fb928f30f19fba0)

To perform Local build please see page:

<aside>
üìå The steps till now should be able to get you to the desired state of the requirement. However for further information or deep dive to the code se below.

</aside>

When apply is complete for the first time, end user will not see any messages returned on the response 

![Screenshot 2022-07-26 at 17.29.42.png](ADR%20-%20PPRO%20125c74beaded4f0daf60da75d72bb1cd/Screenshot_2022-07-26_at_17.29.42.png)

**This is because there is no data yet in the dynamodb**

**to add data for different environment Run below script present in scripts directory**

**1st argument must be the environment and second argument must contain single quotes if string is separated via  space .‚Äú ‚Äù**

```bash
./update-dynamo-table.sh dev 'hello world'
```

After Updating the data, if you hit the url again , you will see the data reflecting as response.
